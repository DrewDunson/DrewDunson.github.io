<p><strong>About Me</strong>
</p>
<p>I am currently a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, planning to major in Finance with a minor in Marketing. I have always grown up wanting to go to this univsersity. I was born in Fort Worth but graduated high school in a small town called Glen Rose. I have two older brothers (Ryan and Collin) who have been exceptional role models for me. I love spending my free time going to sporting events, going to the lake, and hanging out with my family. <br />
